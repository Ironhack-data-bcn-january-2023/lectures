    "# <center> Natural Language Processing (NLP)</center>\n",
    "The [natural language processing](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procesamiento_de_natural_languages), abbreviated PLN3 —in English, natural language processing, NLP— is a field of sciences of computing, artificial intelligence and linguistics that studies the interactions between computers and human language. It deals with the formulation and investigation of computationally efficient mechanisms for communication between people and machines through natural language, that is, the world's languages. It is not about communication through natural languages ​​in an abstract way, but about designing mechanisms to communicate that are computationally efficient —that can be carried out by means of programs that execute or simulate communication—."

    "NLP is considered one of the great challenges of artificial intelligence since it is one of the most complicated and challenging tasks: how to really understand the meaning of a text? How to undertand neologisms, ironies, jokes or poetry? If the strategy/algorithm we use does not overcome these difficulties, the results obtained will be of no use to us.\n",
    "In NLP it is not enough to understand mere words, you must understand the set of words that make up a sentence, and the set of lines that make up a paragraph. Giving a global meaning to the analysis of the text/discourse in order to draw good conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our language is full of ambiguities, of words with different meanings, twists and different meanings depending on the context. This makes NLP one of the most difficult tasks to master.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the difficulty of the NLP is at several levels:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ambiguity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lexical level: for example, several meanings\n",
    "- Referential level: anaphoras, metaphors, etc...\n",
    "- Structural level: semantics is necessary to understand the structure of a sentence\n",
    "- Pragmatic level: double meanings, irony, humor\n",
    "- Gaps detection"

Within seventy-two hours, 3,000 U.S. boats were headed for Cuba. In the next few weeks, it became evident that Castro was forcing the boat owners to carry back with them not only their relatives but the dregs of his jail population. By the time the port was closed 125,000 `Marielitos` had landed in Florida. An estimated 25,000 had criminal records. This is the story of that minority -- those they call `Los Bandidos.`The prologue is shredded diagonally by the blade of astiletto and in the empty black void we:CUT TOOpening Montage - Documentary Footage:2 THE DISEMBARKATIONfrom the harbor in Mariel, Cuba. Vessels of every nature,waving masses, demonstrations....3 THE CROSSINGSun and storm.4 THE LANDING - KEY WESTThe flag of the United States. Choppers swooping over the ragged coastline of the Keys. Emerald waters dotted with fishing trawlers and pleasure craft, an \"America the Beautiful\"-type Immigration theme surging over this.5 THE PROCESSINGLong lines. Immigration and Nationalization Officials, customs, Public Health, FBI, Church and Relief Organizations.Babies bawling, arguments over paperwork, refugees beinginterviewed by TV news, people crying, people eating,families huddled on floors... chaos.The music theme continuing in stately calm as we:CUT TO6 INT. OFFICE - PROCESSING HALL - AFTERNOON -A FULL and CLOSEUP OF7 TONY MONTANA 7the scar-faced one, in the young angry prime of his life.We dwell first on the scar which he likes to scratch now andthen. We move to the eyes, pure in their fury. Finally weencompass the face -- the face of a man about to explode --muscle, tissue, brain -- a man willing to live or die andon the increment of a moment, inflict or receive either one.He is clothed in rags crossed with holes, his shoes brokencardboard, his hair unkempt, his complexion sallow fromprison.Over this:VOICE #1 (o.s.)Okay so what do you call yourself?VOICE #2 (o.s.)Como se llama?MONTANATony Montana...you?VOICE #1Where`d you learn to speak the English, Tony?MONTANAMy old man -- he was American. Sailor. Bum.I always know, y`know, one day I gonna come to America.I see all the movies...VOICE #1So where`s your old man now?MONTANAHe`s dead. He died. Somewhere...VOICE #1Mother?TONYShe`s dead too.VOICE #2What kind of work you do in Cuba, Tony?TONYThis. That. The Army. Some construction work....VOICE #2Unhunh. Got any family in the States, Tony? Cousins, brother-in-law?TONY(a beat)Nobody. Everybody`s dead.MAN #IY`ever been in jail, Tony?TONYMe jail? No way.We now reveal three men in civilian clothing in the dark afternoon light of the little room. Actually it`s a plywood office somewhere in the processing hall and we hear the din from the hall over the question and answer. Two of the men sit around a desk, the Third Man stands in a corner, staring at Tony, the most authoritative-looking of the three.MAN #l(checking off a list)You been in a mental hospital, Tony?TONYYeah, in the boat coming over.MAN #1How `bout homosexuality, Tony? You like men, y`like to dress up like a woman?TONY(to Man #2)Never tried it. What the fuck`s wrong with this guy, what`s he think I am?MAN #2Just answer the questions, Tony.The voices of the men remain cool and collected throughout.TONY(to Man #1)Fuck no.MAN #1Arrested? Vagrancy? Marijuana?TONYNO. ...NO. Never. Nothing.His eye movements are rapid (over shoulders, sides, doors)and he does a lot of touching -- objects -- lightly with thetips of the fingers. Man #3 is stepping forward out of theshadows.MAN #3So where`d you get the beauty scar?TONYThis?..(scratching the scar, shrugs)I was a kid. You should see the other kid.(a grim chuckle)MAN #3And this?He holds up Tony`s hand and indicates the tattoo between thethumb and second finger -- a heart with the word \"Madre\"scaled through it.TONYOh that was for my sweetheart.MAN #3Sweetheart?(to the other men)We been seeing more and more of these. It`s some kinda code these guys used in the can. Pitchfork means an assassinor something. This one`s new... You want to tell us, Montana or you want to take a little trip to the detention center?TONYHey, so I was in the can once for buying dollars. Big deal.MAN #3That`s pretty funny, Tony.TONYSome Canadian tourist....MAN #3What`d you mug him first? Get him outta here!(starts to walk out)TONYHey, so I fuck Castro, what`s it to you? You a Communist or something?How would you like it they tell you all the time what to think, what to do, you wanna be like a sheep, like everybody else. Baa baa? Puta! You want a stoolie on every block? You wanna work eight hours a day and you never own nothing? I ate octopus three times a day, fucking octopus is coming out my ears, fuckin` Russian shoes are eating through my feet. Whaddaya want? You want me to stay there? Hey, I`m no little whore, I`m no stinking thief! I`m Tony Montana and I`m a political prisoner here from Cuba and I want my fucking `Human Rights` just like President Jimmy Carter says, okay?Silence.There`s a certain eloquence to the man`s plea butit falls on disbelieving ears. One of them chuckles.MAN #lCarter should see this human right. He`s good. He`s very good. What do you say Harry?MAN #3(walking out)I... `Freedomtown.` Let them take a look at him.

He takes the Baby Ruth outof Manny`s hand, peels out the bar of chocolate, thenreturns the empty wrapper to Manny,TONYSo what`d you tell them?MANNYI told them what you told me to tell them. I told them I was in sanitation in Cuba.TONYI didn`t tell you sanitation. I told you to tell them you was in a sanitarium, not sanitation.The bus pulling out now.MANNYIs that what you told me? You didn`t tell me that.TONYYou know if you hadn`t opened your mouth, they woulda thought you were a horse. I told you to tell them you had TB and was cured.MANNYFuck you Tony....TONYYou did nothing right. I shoulda left you in Cuba.7-B EXT.

TONY`S TENT - FREEDOMTOWN - NIGHT (SIX MONTHS LATER) 8A movie projector......the face of Bogart -- unshaven, paranoid. We`re watching a badly damaged 16 mm print of The Treasure of the Sierra-Madre. It`s near the end of the film and he`s alone, talking to himself just before the bandits get him....The rag-tag audience is noisily yammering back at the screen,the camera moving past Manny Ray, chewing gum, hair slicked,eyes in cat-like repose... to Tony, enrapt, eyes like an eleven year old, mouth hanging open.BOGARTWhat a thing.Conscience. Conscience.If you believe you`ve got a conscience, it`ll pester you to death. But if you don`t believe you`ve got one, what can it do to you? Makes me sick so much talking and fussing about nonsense.Time to go to sleep.(closes his eyesbut not for long)CUT TO9 INT.

Hunh? Like me....He hunches, darting exaggerated looks over his shoulder,imitating Bogart. Manny laughs. In his black shirt withzig-zag dots and colors and the baggy pants and sunglasses,Tony`s starting to look American. He`s even got himself apop button pinned to his shirt that says \"Fuck Off and Die.\"And his English rolls faster off his tongue, his confidencemore pronounced.TONY. . . don`t trust nobody.MANNYYeah all that gold, hunh -- I guess you get so crazy you never trust nobody no more.TONYNever happen to me, Chico. That`s one thing I never gonna be. I never gonna be crazy like that.MANNYYeah, how do you know....TONYI know.MANNYI don`t know. Sometimes you crazy, too, Tony.TONYAssholes, I go crazy. You Manny, I never go crazy with you. You`relike my brother, I love you!MANNYYeah, sure.TONYHey, c`mon.Tony playfully punches Manny and they walk on into the humid night, intersecting a young punk, Chi-Chi.CHI-CHI(to Manny; Spanish)Hey Manny.MANNYOye Chi-Chi, what`s going down.CHI-CHIUsual shit. Want some peanuts? Pago`s carrying tonight.MANNYI don`t know, I get all fucked up on it....CHI-CHIWant some new snatch? A pussycatname of Yolanda just rolled onto theBoulevard ---MANNYOh yeah, what she look like?CHI-CHIShe look like you `cept she got a snatch.MANNYA real snatch?CHI-CHIYou`re not kidding. It talks.As they chatter, Tony moves on with a movement of the headfor Manny. \"Later.\"He`s in the middle of the \"Boulevard\" where a bustling blackmarket in toiletries, clothing, cigarettes, and transvestites is conducted nightly in the harsh glare of barrack neon.He ambles past a bunch of young guys throwing a Frisbee,past a \"Viva Carter!\" proclamation in graffiti....TRANSVESTITEWhat about you sugar -- you wanna party?TONY(passing her)Yeah with whose cock, honey?CUT TO10 EXT. FREEDOMTOWN GROUNDS - NIGHT 10Tony, five minutes later, in a phone booth, in the middle of a bank of them, dozens of Marielietos pressing to get in, trying still to contact somebody -- anybody -- on the outside.Tony is dialing, his eyes shifting down to the telephonenumber written in pencil on the back of a snapshot- As hefinishes the number, he flips the snapshot over and we seea young girl, about thirteen years old, dark, tiny, fiery,standing together with a dog and Tony, early twenties, inshadow, the fringes of the photo heavily tattered withhandling. Tony stares at it, his mind drifting as the phonerings in a distant place. A brief moment of repose we havenot yet seen in Tony.Someone picks up the phone. An older woman`s Voice. Hisexpression alters to uncertainty.VOICEYes? ...Hello? ...Who is this?Tony changes his mind, hangs up. Pause. The faces of thosein line peer in, the next party raps on the door, but Tonyignores it, slips the snapshot back into the wallet in hispants, then at his own pace, exits the phone booth.He walks a few beats, his eyes pensive. Then recognizessomebody in another phone booth and goes over.Angel Fernandez has got the face of one, as he argues onthe phone, then hangs up, a desolate look on his face, aworn phone book in his hand.TONYAngel, how ya doin`?ANGELYou know how many goddamn Fernandezes are living in fucking Union City? And I gotta call every fucking one of `em to find my brother!TONY(in passing)Don`t waste your dime, Chico. You know your brother hates you.ANGELGo fuck yourself, Tony.Manny catches up to Tony.TONYWhatcha hanging around with that hustler for?MANNYHey Chi-Chi`s okay, he hears things,TONYWhat`s he hear I don`t hear.Angel comes over, listens.MANNYHe hears we got problems.

You think they`re gonna let us out? They`re gonna throw away the key, that`s what.ANGELOh shit!MANNYWhat`s I say. This is gonna end bad, muchachos....TONYHey, I tell you guys this isn`t Cuba here, this is the United States. They got nothing but lawyers here. We`re on the television. We`re in the newspapers. Whatta they gonna do -- ship us back to Cuba? Castro-- he don`t want us. Nobody no place wants us so whatta they gonna do -- put us in a gas chamber so all the people can see? They`re stuck with us, Chico -- they gotta let us go!MANNYYeah, well, what if we gotta sit here another six months, hunh?TONYYou worry too much, mi hermano. Like the man says, `when you got `em by the balls, their hearts and minds gonna follow` --hunh?Tony winks and walks off.The radio is playing hard rock, something like Blondie or Benatar from the stoop of a nearby barrack. Tony loves the sound and swings into it, snapping his fingers and rolling his hips like Presley. He back-peddles, smiling at Manny and Angel.TONY(in awful imitation)`Oh yeah America! Love-to love you baby, oh yeah!`CUT TO11 EXT.

SOSA VILLA - BOLIVIA - DAY 94The camera moves past a spectacular view of the mountainsto a cavernous dining room highlighted by huge paintingsfrom the Spanish classical period and ornate candelabra.At the table are Sosa, Omar, Tony. The Shadow sits impassively in a folding chair off to the side, watching Omar and Tony. Tony is impressed, looking at the plates, the glasses, the silverware, uncomfortable, trying to fit in.He eats the salmon off a silver plate with oafish movements of his knife and fork as the servants move to and fro, constantly hanging dishes, confusing Tony (ad-lib during scene).SOSA(to Omar)...say Lopez guarantees me 150 keys a month for a year, and he picks it up down here, I could sell it to him for as little as 7000 a kilo. You cannot do better than that.OMARWell, we do that, we gotta take therisk of moving it. Also we`d be cutting out the Columbians. Youknow what that means?TONYThat means we gotta go to war with`em.looks over at him, not quite knowing yet what to makeSosaof this guy.SOSAWhen we cut out the Colombians we take risks -- on both sides.TONYSplit the risk.

They got frogmen, they got EC2s with satellite tracking shit in `em, they got fuckin` Bell 209 assault choppers up the ass, we`re losing one out of every nine loads. It`s no duckwalk for us anymore, y`know. Forget it.Omar is looking at him, ready to explode at his blithe assumption of power -- whereas Sosa chuckles, amused by his brashness, starting to be intrigued by this animal.SOSAWhat do you suggest is a fair...?Excuse me.Interrupted, Sosa looks over at his black aide who suddenlyappears at the door, apparently with a message. Sosa waveshim in.The black aide -- The Skull -- is a slim, tall imposing manwith academic, `horn-rimmed glasses and close-cropped hairon a huge and impressive skull. He combines the physical qualities of an animal with an intellectual. As he approaches, he glances down the table, his eyes falling briefly on Omar who doesn`t connect. The Skull falters -- just for a moment -- then continues towards Sosa with the same stony, loyal expression.Sosa lends his ear and the Skull whispers his information.A beat.He whispers a second thought. Sosa reacts minimally.Then he nods, dismissing the Skull who heads out the room.Sosa glances at his gold Rolex.OMAR(meanwhile, in a whisper to Tony)Shaddup willya Montana, I`m doing the talking here!Tony shrugs.SOSAWhere were we?TONYPanama. You`re looking for a partner, right?Omar shoots a poisonous glance at Tony.SOSA...something like that.OMARLook Mr. Sosa, we`re getting ahead of ourselves here. I`m down on Frank`s authority to buy 200 keys, that`s it, that`s my limit. I got no right to negotiate for Frank Lopez on anything larger than that. So why don`t we...TONYHey Omar, why don`t you let the man finish, hunh? Let him propose his proposition.OMARHey Montana, you got no authority here, okay! I started you in this business, all right, so shut the fuck UP!TONYFrank`ll love it. Don`t worry about it.OMARThat`s up to Frank -- not you.He looks embarrassed at Sosa who has been watching, sensing-- also an advantage in the split.OMARI`m sorry about this, Mr. Sosa...SOSAIt`s all right. Maybe your partner`s right. Maybe you should talk toFrank.OMAR(a beat)Okay. I don`t think this is something I want to do on an overseas phone, but I can go back to Miami and talk to Frank personally.SOSA(without hesitation)Good. My chopper can take you to Santa Cruz now. I have a jet there that`ll have you in Miami in five hours.You can be back here tomorrow. For lunch.Omar is taken aback by the speed of the plan.OMARYeah. I guess so....TONYGreat.SOSA(glancing at Tony, to Omar)...leave your friend here. While you`re gone maybe he can tell me how to run my business.OMAR(doesn`t get it)I don`t think that...TONY(lighting a cigar)Hey, it`s okay.

Tony watches her go.TONYI gotta hand it to you. You got everything a man could want.Sosa, pleased, reaches for an expensive set of binoculars on the patio table, looks up through them, at the helicopter rising off the lawn.SOSA(focusing the binoculars)I like you Tony. There`s no lying in you... Unfortunately I don`t feelthe same way about the rest of your organization.Tony glances up at the chopper, the servant pouring coffee for him.TONYIn-- l -- Whaddaya getting at, Mr. Sosa?SOSAI mean Omar Suarez.Tony, puzzled, glances up at the chopper which now hovers there high above the estate.Sosa passes him the binoculars.SOSAThis garbage was recognized by my associate at lunch.From several years ago, in New York.

My associate used to work up there.Through the binoculars -- they throw Omar out of thechopper and he flies downwards and jerks back up as the rope stretches taut, snapping his neck. He hangs there like a broken doll on a string as the chopper moves out of sight.A silence.97 TONY 97shaken, lowers the binoculars.Sosa watches him closely for his reaction.Tony looks back at him, contemplative.Sosa goes over, pours himself some coffee.SOSASo how do I know you`re not a `chivato` too Tony?TONY(awry, stalks up to him)Hey Sosa -- get this straight right now !

I found him stoned in the jungle and there`s nothing you`ll ever see like him. I present with great pride, from Caracas, Venezuela -- `Octavia` !Lights dimming to the bluesy rhythm of the Sinatra song assad-eyed Octavia suddenly appears in the shifting spot-light drawing immediate laughter.He is dressed as an enormously fat old man with a Quasimodomask covering both the front and back of his head and neck.With a red bulb for a nose, he gyrates grotesquely to the sleek song; once the mood of laughter has been established, the music suddenly shifts upbeat to \"Saturday Night Fever\" and the clown, like a butterfly from a worm, starts shedding the stuffing from his clothes, his big eyes staring out at us in theatrical melancholy.Tony watches, sitting alone, distracted by the clown.More laughter, more clothes coming off, building a tempo.When the head mask comes off, we see the gaunt handsomeface of a young clown in white paint with the largeblackened eyes staring without expression at the laughingaudience.Tony is hooked by the image, looks on.The clown is down to his leotards, thin as a stick, andpulling the girls out onto the floor to dance with him,bouncing around like yo-yos. Everybody is laughing, everybody is merry......except Tony and the clown, weaving in and out of thesharpening spotlight in his white face as the act comes toits close, a haunting figure of mockery....Tony, absorbed by his thoughts, is lucky this time.

Machine gun fire rips through the upholstery,smashing the mirrors...Screams, crowd diving for cover...Tony, hit in the shoulder, rolls, gets his Beretta out ofhis ankle, firing...Hits one of the gunmen in the chest; the man staggers across the disco floor firing volleys into the mirrors and ceilings...Tony moving under the tables, towards the door, firing...The second hitter is pinned, firing back, breaking moremirrors, and more screaming.Tony lets the gunman have another burst then runs out thedoor, his clothes ripped with blood and glass.The clown, Octavia, lies dead on the silent dance floor.CUT TO114 EXT.

A segment now in progresswith the \"Donahue-type\" interviewing Dr. Orlando Gutierrez.Gutierrez is a young charismatic man, very well dressed andpolished in a South American manner who exudes a sense ofenormous passion.GUTIERREZMore than 10,000 of our people are being tortured and held without trial. In the past two years, another 6,000 have simply disappeared. And your government -- what does it do? Itsells my government tanks, planes, guns, but not a word -- not-a whisper-- about human rights!INTERVIEWERI`ve heard whispers, Doctor Gutierrez, about the financial support your government receives from the drug industry in Bolivia.GUTIERREZThe irony, of course, is that this money -- which is in the billions,Jim - - is coming from your country. You are the major purchaser of our national product -- which of course is cocaine.INTERVIEWERSo what you`re saying Doctor Gutierrez is the United States Government is spending millions of dollars to eliminate the flow of drugs into our streets and at the same time is doing business with the very same government that floods those` streets with cocaine... that`s a bit like robbing Peter to pay Paul, isn`t it?GUTIERREZLet me show you some of the other characters in the comedy, Jim... my organization just recently traced a purchase by this man --Gutierrez holds up a photograph -- insert the face on the TVscreen, dour, ruthless.GUTIERREZ. . . here he is, the charming face belongs to General Cucombre, the Defense Minister of my country.

Not your ordinary drug dealer....INTERVIEWERWhat are you suggesting we do about this, Doctor?GUTIERREZThe United States Government has to stop supporting these fascist gangsters that are running my country, that is what your country has to do. You have to set a strong example by calling for the observation of fundamental human rights.171 TONY 171staring intently at him, reluctantly impressed.GUTIERREZYou Americans have no idea how important your country is as asymbol and a bastion of those rights. You have no....Sosa flips off the television. The lights come on. He`s alone with Tony.SOSA...he`s scheduled next for 60 Minutes. He`s going on French, British, Italian, Japanese television.

How, Dies Santo, did you become such a monster, such an ugly little monster....Tony slams the door, we hold a beat on her face -- as if she had finally answered her own questions.218 EXT. MOTHER`S HOUSE 218Tony stomps into his white Corniche, Ernie discreetlyclosing the door and getting in with Chi-Chi as Mama ripsopen her door in b.g. and stands there staring from thedoorway -- weeping and staring across the dark. Tonytakes a strong hit of coke. The car whistles off.CUT TO219 EXT. HOUSE - COCONUT GROVE - THAT NIGHT 219Tony in the backseat of the Corniche with Chi-Chi studiesthe house from across the curb. It`s quiet, rich, suburban,not calling attention to itself.Tony, seething, snorts another line of coke laid out on thecrystal bar dividing the backseat, and rewed, goes.TONY(to Chi-Chi)Wait here.He approaches the front door, listening, the hand sliding into his pocket. Inside a wistful Billy Joel song plays over the stereo. He rings a buzzer, waits.Hold the pause. The door opens casually. Standing there is Manny -- with a towel around his waist.MANNYTony?Tony stares, stunned.Gina now comes into view behind Manny -- in a bathrobe, abig smile of welcome for her brother.GINATony!(eyes suddenly moving downward in alarm)Tony with his Beretta pointed at Manny, his expression filled with loathing.Manny smiles easily and shrugs, the gesture drawing Tony over the edge.MANNYHey Tony, c`mon we was....The gun fires.GINATony! No!Tony fires a second time.Manny slowly slumps downward against the doorjamb, eyes on Tony, terribly surprised.Tony holds the gun, staring down, separated from himself.Manny lies at his feet, dead.GINAManny!She goes down to her knees, stunned out of her mind, shakes him.GINAManny!She looks up, insanely, at Tony, her eyes huge with disbelief.GINAYou killed him?Shaking her head at him incredulously.GINAWe got married just yesterday. We were gonna surprise you.Tony stands there, doubly stunned by the news.GINAManolo, oh Manolo, what`d he do?What`d he do?She hugs his corpse tightly to her breast and makeshorrible strangled sounds with her throat.Chi-Chi hurrying up to Tony, worried somebody`s seen the shooting. Ernie follows.CHI-CHITony, come on. We gotta get out of here(to Gina)Come on baby...Gina!Suddenly she goes berserk.GINANoooooooooooo!And shoving Chi-Chi aside, launches herself on Tony, screaming incoherently like a madwoman, trying to kill him. She beats him around the head, the chest, scratches furrows of flesh from his face. He stands there, oblivious, numbed.Chi-Chi and Ernie have a demon on their hands. They manage at last to yank her off Tony, kicking and continuing to scream.220 EXT. MANNY`S HOUSE - NIGHT 220Lights coming on in the houses around the neighborhood.Chi-Chi and Ernie, desperate now, drag her forcefully alongthe pavement into the Corniche. She continues to scream.ERNIE(to Chi-Chi)Get the body!Tony, back at the door, looks down again.The eyes of Manolo staring sightlessly.Chi-Chi runs back, grabs Tony.CHI-CHITony!Pulls him. Tony snaps out of it.TONYYeah!He goes. Chi-Chi lifting Manny`s body, hauling it.Tony getting into the Corniche, Ernie pinning Gina against the front seat. Chi-Chi propping Manny into the driver`s seat with him. The car roars away.The camera closing on Gina as she looks through the glass partition of the Corniche, at the slumped head of Manny in foreground, the music surging inexorably.GINAManny! ...Manny! No!CUT TO -221 MIAMI STREETS - NIGHT 221The white Corniche whistles by like a hearse heading for hell.222 EXT. TONY`S MANSION GROUNDS - THAT NIGHT 222It goes roaring by the front gate and up the driveway,gravel flying.The camera curving to reveal two sedans inching up theshadowed street, towards us, their lights out. The cars stop.Eight men emerge silently, blending into the shadows of the trees.223 INT. TONY`S MANSION - NIGHT 223Tony, scratches across his face, strides through the frontdoor into the marble foyer. Another Marielito is waitingfor them at the door.Ernie and Chi-Chi are almost carrying Gina, who is numb with shock.CHI-CHIWhat do we do with her Tony?TONYDo what? Where? Put her upstairs.Put her in my bedroom.(to Gina)It`ll be all right, pussycat, you`ll see everything`11 be okay, I`ll takecare of you....She looks up at him through her stupor and spits in his face. Chi-Chi and Ernie pull her away -- as Tony stares, upset but passive.They trundle her up the stairs. Tony turns and walks away.224 INT. TONY`S OFFICE - NIGHT 224Tony slumps on his couch. A haze of coke rises off the velvet like a snow scene painting on a Christmas card.Oblivious to the dust, he cuts open a fresh plastic kilo bag of coke and spreads the entire pound out across the black marble coffee table.Ernie and Chi-Chi come in.CHI-CHIWe got some pills into her, she`s cooling down.Tony pays no attention, Ernie and Chi-Chi noticing the pile of coke.Flashing his silver tooter, Tony snorts a truly giant amount in a large pendular swing of his elbow across the length of coffee table.Pause as he lets it sink in.CHI-CHIBoss, what we gonna do now?TONYDo? We`re gonna war that`s what we gonna do.We gonna eat Sosa for breakfast. We`re gonna close thatfucker down.Ernie and Chi-Chi sharing a look.CHI-CHI(eyeing the coke)Hey Tony, why don`t you go easy on that stuff, hunh?Tony looks up at him, focuses. The eyes are uncompromising.Ernie, a little scared of him now, turns away. Chi-Chi follows.Tony starts on another trek along the coffee table.CUT TO225 EXT. TONY`S MANSION GROUNDS - LATER THAT NIGHT 225The Bengal tiger paces his spot, restless.A monsoon-like wind blows through the trees on the estate.The monkeys listen quietly.The flamingoes flutter.. . . Then there`s a burst of loud music from the stereo speakers on the balcony -- a Billy Joel song, something smooth and easy about the high times and how fast they go.... . . and we see Tony, in long shot, throw open the terrace doors and stagger out onto the balcony, overlooking his estate.. . . On a closer angle, we track him to the edge of thebalustrade. He`s done so much coke now he`s practicallycatatonic; staggering and muttering to himself.TONY. . . Jesus fuckin` Christ whatsa matter with me, get a hold of y`self now these cocksuckers gonna run over you, let `em try, I bury the cocksuckers....His point of view -- panning his estate. The dark emptiness echoes back at him. The wind rustling the treetops.Tony shaking his head at himself, he starts to cry!TONY...Ooooh fuck Manny, how the fuck did I do that? How the fuck! ...oh Manny, Manny ...you were there for me, you were the one, Manny, you understood, always understood...Well what the hell happened, hunh?What the hell happened to us?...In far background. now, behind Tony, on the video monitors in his office we see:The main gate and guard shack -- a Marielito crosses into view, checks the gate, turns. Suddenly two figures springout at him. One of them garrotting the Marielito. He struggles.Another monitor now reveals two more figures moving intothe interior of the guard shack. They knife the other Marielito.A third monitor carries another image of shadows movingthrough the trees on the estate.On the balcony, Tony is oblivious to it all, spent, almostincoherent.TONY...I said to you, Manny, I said I never go crazy and you said, I wouldyou sonofabitch and you was right... those were the good days hunh, we was crazy back in those days, we`d do anything, you and me, we was on the way up, nobody nothing coulda stopped us cause we were the best hunh -- the fucking best...As Tony turns and starts back through the terrace doors into his study, the camera glides around to a view of a hook flying up and catching the balustrade. A shadow starts climbing up as:TONY...we still are Manny, we still are-- see, I`m gonna wipe out all them fuckers out there, I`m gonna run the market, I`m gonna be King Cocaine you hear me, you buy, you buy from me -- Tony Montana. Covers of all the magazines. Fan mail. Television stars, movie stars, shooting stars -- he`s a star....226 INT. TONY`S MANSION - OFFICE 226As he crosses into his office, the camera moves to reveal Gina standing there half-dressed in the doorway, her eyes blazing with hatred.Tony sees her.She steps forward, offering her body almost naked to herbrother.GINAIs this what you want Tony?...Tony shocked.GINAYou can`t stand another man touching me. So you want me Tony, is that it? Well here I am.She fires the Baretta we now see in her hand.The bullet grazes Tony in the leg, snapping him from his catatonia as he goes reeling across the floor behind his desk. She fires again. Again.GINAI`m all yours Tony, I`m all yours now.Bullets ripping into the desk. She advances, offering her sex, methodically shooting out the clip at rhythmic intervals.GINACome and get me Tony. Before it`s too late.He spins across the run away from the desk, trying to putdistance between them. She sees him scurrying,. turns, anexpression like a demented angel.GINACome on Tony, fuck me! Fuck me! Fuck me!Advancing on him, firing. The furniture tearing up, the chairspilling, television sets and computer toys shattering, Tonysquirming away, hit again in the thigh, shocked, scramblingover to the terrace windows. Her next shot shatters the window and as Tony ducks again to the side, we see outside onto the terrace behind him:A young Columbian punk no more than twenty -- one of thehitters -- is crouched there, reacting to the broken window.He doesn`t hesitate, turning his machine gun on Gina.Gina is torn to pieces by the firepower -- blown across theroom, spine severed and dead before she hits the floor.Tony sees it, yells something, in the same instant swivels to knock the barrel of the machine gun aside.The punk is taken by surprise, not having seen Tony, and Tony now runs him backwards across the balcony and hurls him over the balustrade.The punk lands in one of the shallow pools on the groundsat the base of the balcony.Tony, from above, grabs up the punk`s machine gun andempties the whole clip into the figure thrashing in the pool below.Ernie runs into view on the far side of the pool, spots Tony, yells up ---ERNIEGet outta here!Tony, they`re everywhere!Ernie suddenly wheels, hit in the face, by a burst of silencer bullets.We catch a brief glimpse of Sosa`s black aide, the Skull,moving quickly along the wall of the house -- directlyunderneath the balcony on which Tony stands.Tony, tossing the empty machine gun aside, wildly runs backinto his office to get more guns, crosses to Gina corpse.It takes him by surprise. He comes to a dead stop, kneels, looking questioningly in her face.TONYHey Gina come on, you still angry at me? I didn`t mean to kill Manny, I was... I was.Running his hands along her face, trying to rouse her, gently lifting her eyelids. Blood`s running out of her mouth in rivers.TONY tx:Come on Gina, get off the floor.You`re all dirty now, you need a bath...Mami`s gonna be angry baby-- ooh is she gonna be mad at me!..Come on open your eyes my baby,open your eyes.. -give me a smile.There`s been a steady pounding and calling now on the door of the office. Tony finally hears it, looks up, then over at the monitors.One of them reveals Chi-Chi standing there outside the doorpounding it.CHI-CHIBoss ! Hey boss. Open up!On the monitor we see Chi-Chi suddenly spin and open firedown into the foyer. Return fire decimates him. A grenadegoes off, blows him up against the door.TONYCheeee!He now seems to come out of his catatonia, runs to hissideboard, hauls out a rocket shoulder-fired rocket launcher and straps an Uzi across his shoulder. He looks up at the monitor.On the monitors, the hitters are now darting across thefoyer and coming up the left and right hand stairs.Three of them are already huddled outside the door, aroundthe corpse of Chi-Chi, motioning to-each other, laying a grenade at the base of the door to blow it out.Tony loading his rocket, intends to beat them to the punch,talking to himself.TONYSo you wanna play hunh, say hello to my little friend here.Karroooomph!The rocket tears down the door and blows the Columbian punks off the landing into the foyer.It sounds like Armageddon, one of the hitters screaming, smoke billowing wildly.Tony, at the height of his mad glory, steps out at the apexof the stairs, firing his machine gun and yelling.TONYWhores! Cowards! You think you can kill me with lousy bullets hunh?Another hitter tumbles down the right-hand stair.TONYWho you think I am? I kill all you fuckin` assholes. I take you all to fuckin` hell!Another hitter drops, screaming, off the stairs into the pool below.A grenade goes off. Tony is hit again, but keeps on firingaway. Laughing like a madman.TONYYou need an army you hear! An army to kill me!Behind him we see the remainder of the pound of cocaine goup in a burst of wind, whipping around the office in auras of white. It is a ghostly effect out of which now appears the face of the Skull moving from the terrace towards Tony`s back with a sawed-off shotgun.TONYHa ha ha ha ha! You whores, you scum, I piss in your faces!!!! Ha ha ha ha ha!!The Skull, now inches from Tony`s back, pulls the trigger and blows Tony`s spine out his belly.Tony crashes forward over the banister into the interiorswimming pool below.He floats quietly face down in the lit blue waters.As the titles begin their crawl up, the music theme isexpressive salsa with a dash of gaiety.The camera moving off Tony to catch the reflection of the lit sculpture on the surface of the still waters. It says:\"THE WORLD IS YOURS\"And so, for the brief moment, it was.Our camera now distancing itself from the body in the pool,panning past the dream villa, past the shambles and thewealth, past the hitters pillaging and looting and drawingthat obscene word \"Chivato\" in blood on the outside walls,past the stacks of cash blowing across the floor like leaves in autumn, with the looters running after it across the busted door with the tropic wind blowing down CoconutGrove -- to the Miami skyline across Biscayne BayTHE ENDEmbed'"
